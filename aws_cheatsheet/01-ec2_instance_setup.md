# Set up EC2 Instance

## üöÄ Launching the Instance

1. Launch AWS lab, and start the lab on Canvas. Click the green-lit **AWS** button on Canvas, and you will be redirected to AWS web interface.
2. Search for **‚ÄúEC2‚Äù** in the AWS Management Console.
3. Click **‚ÄúLaunch an instance‚Äù**.
4. Add a **name** (e.g., `sky-mds`).
5. Under **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**:
   - Click on: **Ubuntu**
   - Choose: **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, leaving 64-bit (x86)**
   - üîç **Note**: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is not a Docker image.  
     - Docker image = lightweight, contains virtual environment to use a software or reproduce code
     - AMI = full virtual machine including OS and root filesystems

6. Under **Instance Type**, select `t2.medium` for lecture/practice purposes, and select `t2.large` for your milestone:

    - This is the "hardware" setting of your virtual machine

7. Under **Key pair (login)**:
   - If it's your first time setting up this cluster: Click **‚ÄúCreate a new key pair‚Äù**, name it, key pair type = RSA, private key file format = pem, and **download the `.pem` file**.
   - Save the key-pair somewhere secure.
   - If setting up again: Choose the existing key pair you previously created.

8. Under **Network Settings**:
   - Select default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnet.

9. Under **Network Settings** ‚Üí **Firwall (Security Groups)**:
   - Create or select a security group.
   - Ensure the following **rules** are checked:
     - ‚úÖ Allow SSH traffic from Anywhere
     - ‚úÖ Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet
     - ‚úÖ Allow HTTP traffic from the internet

10. Under **Configure storage**:
    - Use root as storage with **30 GB** (recommended)
    - Select **General purpose SSD (gp2)** as volume type to reduce costs

11. Under **Advanced details**:
    - Click the toggle to expand, scroll to the bottom and add the following code chunk into the **"User data - optional"** section.
    - Replace `<admin-user-name>` with your **JupyterHub admin username** (e.g., `sky`).
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This username is for The Littlest JupyterHub inside of the EC2 instance ‚Äî *not* the username for you to SSH login into your EC2 instance.

    Example:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    curl -L https://tljh.jupyter.org/bootstrap.py \
        | sudo python3 - \
    --admin <admin-user-name>
    ```

12. click "launch instance"
13. After launching, search for your EC2 instance under **Instances** to monitor its status.
    - Check "Instance State", see if it's "running" or "stopped"
    - If "stopped", click on the hyperlinked ID listed under "Instance ID", and click button "Instance State" > "Start instance". You may need to wait for 15‚Äì20 minutes.
    - You can also check **System Logs** during setup.

14. Click the **Connect** button on your instance page.
    - Choose the **SSH Client** tab
    - Follow the instructions to connect

## üßë‚Äçüíª Logging into EC2 Instance as Admin/Host

1. Open your **terminal** or **command prompts** in your local computer
2. Use `cd` to move to the directory where your private key (`.pem`) is saved
3. Run:
    ```bash
    chmod 400 <your-key.pem>
    ```
    e.g.:
    ```bash
    chmod 400 sky-mds.pem
    ```

    ### üîê Why use `chmod 400`?

    - `chmod`: change file permission mode, changes who can read, write and execute this file
    - First digit (4): read permission for the owner
    - Second (0): no permissions for others in the same group
    - Third digits (0): no permissions for everyone else, the rest of the world
    - If any digit is (6) = 4+2 = read(4) + write(2) permission
    - If any digit is (7) = 4+2+1 = read(4) + write(2) + execute(1) permission
    - If any digit is (5) = 4+1 = read(4) + execute(1) permission

    ‚úÖ Reasons to use `chmod 400`:
    - **SSH security**: Many SSH clients (including OpenSSH) will refuse to use private key files with "insecure" permissions. Required by OpenSSH to avoid ‚Äúpermissions too open‚Äù error when trying to connect.
    - **Protect against malware**: Restricts access to private key. If your computer gets infected with malware, more restrictive permissions can provide an extra layer of protection against automated scripts trying to access sensitive files.
    - **Avoid accidental modification**: Avoid accidentally modifing or corrupting the key file, which would render it unusable
    - **Safety on shared systems**: If you ever use your key on a system where others might have access (even temporarily), the permissions ensure they can't read or modify it.

4. Connect using `ssh`:

    ```bash
    # Syntax
    ssh -i <path_to_private_key.pem> <username>@<ec2_hostname>

    # Example
    ssh -i ~/Downloads/sky-mds.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-555-555-555.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

    - `-i` = identity file (your private key)
    - Default username for Ubuntu AMI is `ubuntu`
    - Where is **<ec2_hostname>**: click on the hyperlinked ID listed under "Instance ID", and then copy the address listed under **"Public IPv4 DNS"**

5. To log out of the instance, type:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes About Billing

- Typing `exit` **does not stop AWS from charging you**
- You must click **‚ÄúStop Instance‚Äù** in the web interface to pause compute charges
- Stopping preserves your data storage (storage still incurs storage cost)
- Clicking **‚ÄúTerminate Instance‚Äù** deletes the instance permanently including data storage ‚Äî no further charges
