## ðŸ¦¦ Mission: Rescue Ollie the Otter!

### Meet Ollie the Otter

Ollie is a curious little otter who dreams of becoming a **Data Scientist**. She lives peacefully by the riverbank, spending her evenings on her otter-sized laptop learning **Linux** so she can:

- Organize her **fish collection**,
- Analyze **clam crunching patterns**,
- Clean up her **messy shell data**.

She's built her own folder system, crafted clever Bash scripts, and was about to publish her first shellfish dataset...

---

### ðŸš¨ Plot Twist: Ollie Has Been Captured!

But something went wrong.

A clown â€” a mysterious entity known only as **`Umbu`** â€” showed up today in Ollie's home, kidnapped her and **locked her in a hidden dungeon directory** and taken over her riverbank workstation.

Now it's up to **you**, the command-line hero, to **rescue Ollie** and restore order to her filesystem.

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Mission

Using only **Linux commands**, you will:

- Navigate through suspicious directories,
- Identify suspicious files planted by **Umbu**,
- And **unlock the dungeon** to free her.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Can You Save Ollie?

The command line is your map.  
The terminal is your sword.  
And Ollieâ€™s future as a Data Scientist depends on **your Linux skills**.

Let the mission begin.
