Day... Iâ€™ve lost count.

Itâ€™s dark here, but the ocean's rhythm still echoes in my memory.  
I miss the sound of seagulls. The feeling of cool sand under my paws. The terminal under my whiskers...

The dungeon isnâ€™t just cold â€” itâ€™s *coded*.  
It listens only to its owner... I tried everything: `ls`, `cd`, even whispered sweet `sudo` commands. Nothing worked.

But if someone out there can *change the owner*, maybeâ€”just maybeâ€”it will let me go.  
And if you can find meâ€¦ you can use **move** me back home.

Iâ€™m in here. Iâ€™m still here.  
I believe in you.
