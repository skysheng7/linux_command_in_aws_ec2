Grrrhh... Who dares disturb the shadows?

This dungeon... it is not just stone and silence.  
It breathes. It listens. It *obeys* only its master.  
You may knock, shout, even offer snacks — but without the true owner's name?  
The doors won't budge. The files won't speak. The secrets stay sealed.

The dungeon is magical, yes...  
But loyalty like this? It's dangerous.

Only the one with their name etched in the system — the owner — can command this place.  
You want control? You must change the name it listens to.

Until then...  
I remain...  
Trapped in the chmod mist... and chown chains.
