Snrrrkkk... Who goes there? Oh. You again. Another hero, huh?

Fine. I’ll tell you what I know. Not like anyone listens to an old dungeon monster anymore...

You wanna free someone from this place?  
You don’t *break* the walls. You *move* them.

The system doesn’t care *how* they leave — it only sees locations.  

Simple. Sneaky. Clean.

No alarms. No battles. Just... *mv away*.  
Like it never happened.

But don’t tell the clown I told you.  
He hates it when prisoners walk free.
