Pwwwwd! Oh, sorry — I mean pwd. That stands for Print Working Directory — but don’t worry, you’re not printing anything on paper. I don’t even have a printer down here! 🖨️🌊

When you type pwd, you’re asking:
‘Hey, Fish, where am I swimming right now in this big ol’ file ocean?’

And I say:
‘You’re here, buddy!’
Then I show you the full path — like:
/home/fish/treasure_chest/snacks/seaweed

It’s like checking your underwater GPS. 🧭
So if you’re ever lost in a maze of folders, just pwd and boom — you know exactly which coral cave you’re chilling in.
