Clamp down on chaos with chmod!
It stands for change mode, and it lets you set who can read, write, or run a file.

Think of it like a shell door:
	•	r = read (peek inside)
	•	w = write (make changes)
	•	x = execute (open and run it)

So chmod 755 myscript.sh means:
Owner gets full control (7), others can peek & run (5).

Nice, tight security — just how us clams like it!
