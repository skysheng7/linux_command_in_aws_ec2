Mkdir? That’s how you make a nice, cozy new shell — I mean, folder. Just plop it there and fill it with whatever shiny things you like.

And rmdir? Well… that’s how you politely remove an empty folder.
If it’s got stuff inside? Nope. Not happening. Gotta clean it out first — I don’t do messy goodbyes.

Simple. Safe. Just like a clam’s life should be. 🐚📦
