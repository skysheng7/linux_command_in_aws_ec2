Head gives you the opening lines of a file — the polite intro, the appetizer, if you will.
Tail? Ah, that’s the juicy ending, the final act, the last wave before the tide rolls out.

By default, they show 10 lines — but if you’re picky, you can ask for more or less.

Want to watch the file grow in real time, like waves lapping at your shell?
Tail can follow along — loyal, quiet, and ever-watchful.

Honestly, these two are my favorite gossip tools.
