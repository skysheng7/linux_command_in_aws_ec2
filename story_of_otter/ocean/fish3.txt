Okay so like, chown? Thatâ€™s short for change owner â€” and itâ€™s how you say,
â€˜This file? Yeah, itâ€™s mine now.â€™ ðŸ’…

Letâ€™s say you downloaded a cool new shell-script but it belongs to someone else â€” rude.
You just do:
sudo chown me:me party_script.sh
Boom ðŸ’¥ â€” Iâ€™m the owner now, and the group is also set to me. Total takeover.

You can also give it to someone else:
sudo chown oyster:clam secrets.txt
Now Oyster owns it, and Clamâ€™s the group. Hope they donâ€™t fight over it again ðŸ™„.

Just donâ€™t forget the sudo â€” changing ownership is serious business in the reef.
