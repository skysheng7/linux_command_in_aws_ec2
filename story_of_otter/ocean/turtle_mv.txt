🐢💬 Mv is the slow-and-steady way to move things from one place to another — like tucking your favorite shell into a new corner of the reef.

But here’s the secret — it also renames things.
Change a file’s name? Mv.
Move it to a new folder? Mv.

👉 mv fish_notes.txt ocean_wisdom.txt
Now it’s the same file, just with a new name. No drama.

Or maybe you want to tuck it safely into your archive folder:

👉 mv ocean_wisdom.txt archive/
Now it’s still ocean wisdom, just… relocated. Cozy and organized, like a proper shell collection.

It’s calm, quiet, and efficient — just like me. No need to rush when you know exactly where you’re going. 🐢📦✨
Oh — and if you use a *, it means “everything that matches,” like saying, ‘Grab all the shells that start with fish_’ in one slow, smooth sweep.
