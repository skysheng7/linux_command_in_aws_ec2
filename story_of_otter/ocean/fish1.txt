Ahh, cd — my favorite swimming move! 🏊‍♂️
It stands for change directory — like saying:
‘Take me to another coral cave, please!’

You use it like this:
cd treasure_chest/ → swim into that folder
cd .. → swim backward to the parent cave
cd ~ → back home! 🏠 (your fishy home folder)

Just think of cd as flipping your fins and gliding to a new spot in the file reef. 🌊💻

Now don’t get lost in the sea — use pwd if you do!
