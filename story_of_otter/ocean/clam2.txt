Nano? Oh, that’s my kind of tool — simple, quiet, and gets the job done. It’s a basic text editor you can open right in the terminal.

You just type your thoughts, notes, fish poems — whatever.

When you’re ready to save, press Ctrl + O.
Done writing? Press Ctrl + X to exit.

No fuss, no barnacles. Just you and your file. Click click.
