Listen here, whippersnapper — sudo stands for ‘superuser do’, and it’s not for playin’ around! 🛑

You use sudo when you need admin-level power — like changing deep system stuff, installing software, or poking places your little fish fins normally can’t reach.

So if you type:
sudo apt install kelp-snacks
you’re saying: ‘Hey system, I swear I’m responsible — please let me do this grown-up thing.’

But beware! With great power comes great potential to wreck the reef. 🐠💥 One wrong command and poof — your whole fish tank’s empty.

Use sudo wisely, like I do. Or don’t — and learn the hard way like your cousin did when he tried sudo rm -rf /… poor lad.
